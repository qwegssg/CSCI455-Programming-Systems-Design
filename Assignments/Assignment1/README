CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

YR

----------------------------------------------
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

double scale = (double)(getHeight() - 2 * VERTICAL_BUFFER) / getNumTrials;

The bug is about the data type. When I first ran the program, the bars were 
occasionally not displayed onto the window. When I printed out the value of 
scale, the value showed zero. Then I noticed there was something wrong with 
data type. I used cast operator to solve this problem. 

Before assigning the value to scale variable, the cast operation converts 
integer type value to double type so that the result of the operation comes 
to double type.

The cast operation is in section 4.2.5 of the textbook.

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:



----------------------------------------------
ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

1. Probability of two heads: 0.25;
   Probability of one head and one tail: 0.5;
   Probability of two tails: 0.25.
   The first coin shows head, while the second coin show tail, the result will
show one head and one tail. In addition, the result will also show one head and 
one tail when the first shows tail and the second shows head. However, the result
will show two heads only if both of coins shows head, same as the result of two
tails. Therefore, the result of one head and one tail is different from the other.

2. 5000.

3. The largest value that worked correctly: 42949673.
   The value that overflowed: 42949674.
